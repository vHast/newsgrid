          <h1 class="l-heading">About Me</h1>
          <p> For some reason I've always had a huge interest in music</p>
          <p>The first album I've ever bought with, of course, my parents money, I was seven years old and bought Eminem's "Eminem Show" and I was amazed by it.</p>
          <p>As I grew older I've started to listen to different music, I could say that my first contact with rock music was <span class="bold">Sarsippius Ark</span> by Infectious Grooves, I plan to review this album in the future, this album in some kind of way made me realize how emotional music can make you feel, at this day, I've never heard anything better than the bass from Infectious Grooves music, the bassist went to Metallica by the way, a waste of talent if you ask me</p>
          <p>Anyway, back into subject, I realized that music and emotion are two linked things, after that, <span class="bold">Significant Other </span> from Limp Bizkit came out, and that was the breaking point, teenage angst, agressiveness, this is when I started growing my hair long.</p>
          <p>After that, it all came together, I used to play games aswell, GTA Vice City had a specific radio that played lots of new romantic/new wave music, started to listen to Michael Jackson, Laura Branigan, Blondie, The Human League, basically the starter pack of 80s nostalgia dude,</p>
          <p>As I grew up older, I started taking interest in my own history and ancient traditions of my forebears, and for my surprise I just discovered Black Metal, a genre that I hold dear because of that, I don't think there's a genre that takes traditions and culture so seriously as Black Metal does, artists like Sabaton or Manowar try to, but you can't compare it with Drudkh or Burzum for example.</p>
          <p>And since my 20s I've opened my mind to different genres and I realized that many of my friends don't know nothing about those albums and when I started sharing them, they actually liked them and asked me for more similar albums.</p>
          <p>Not gonna lie here but that makes you feel pretty good.</p>
          <p>And of course there's the psychological aspect of music, and for this I have to speak about Joy Division's <span class="bold">Unknown Pleasures</span> , this album as Fantano stated, is a slow burner, and I could say it's a slow burner of your soul, everyone has gone through terrible times and music that states the same feeling makes you cope with it, at least in my own experience.</p>
          <p>I've met several people with really fucked up past and had extremely good taste in music, but maybe that's just me.</p>
          <p>Anyway if you've ended up reading here, I just wish you to enjoy what I'm trying to do here, and read Marcus Aurelius <span class="bold">Meditations</span></p>
