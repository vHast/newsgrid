          <p>The reason behind I created this website, I wanted to write something really serious about this piece of art.</p>
          <p>I've been trying to get my hands on the original vinyl on Discogs but there's none, I hoped they did a repress like they did with Takako Mamiya but found nothing, this is a must own piece of art and I'll explain you why</p>
          <p>With just the few first seconds you can already feel this is going to be a wild ride.</p>
          <p>As soon as Yoshiko's starts singing, in a jolly way, you can appreciate the beautiness of her voice, uplifting, satisfactory.</p>
          <p>The whole album is a ride, but specially, the second song, is what I could call perfection, the reach of her voice, the composition of the whole song, she sings in a special way, you won't understand a thing about what she's singing, but the whole thing is sung in a way that soothes your mind.</p>
          <p>You can find some cheesiness with the use of synthesizers, specially in the third song but if you stick with it it's a pretty good song, and of course the funk/R&B influence but it's understandable because this is a 70's album and they had an english artist but I don't remember the name and I can't find it now  </p>
          <p>You can feel that the point of this album aims to be a folk album with some psychodelic rock themes mixed in, Yuji Ohno was involved in the production of this album and you can clearly see his influence in the fourth song</p>
          <p>Now, when you reach the fifth song, that's where the Japanese folkore kicks in, plenty of traditional japanese instruments blend in, and then Yoshiko starts singing and reaches points that fits perfectly, the whole melody sounds like a fucking miracle, this song is the epitome of beauty.</p>
          <p>But hold your horses until the ninth song, this one holds a bit of melancholy, she's going to let out a faint scream and then the violins start kicking in, after that, she comes back with her calm voice back on track, this is one of the most emotional moments of the album.</p>
          <p>I swear to god I wish I understood what she says.</p>
          <p> And to wrap this amazing album, she ends with a chill song that reminds me of a Carpenters song, I wouldn't be amazed if Karen Carpenter was an inspiration. </p>
          <p>Yoshiko doesn't only provide you with a great album, but with an unforgivable experience.</p>
          <p>And this is an album you should own.</p>
